# Image-Compression-using-Linear-Algebra
In a decade where the pursuit of space-related achievements is inevitable, it seems  almost necessary to nurture and fast-track the growth of national space programs. This  research has aimed to provide for the Egyptian Space Agency a comprehensive report of  suitable approaches to compress images during future space exploration and deep space  missions. The implementation of this technology will hopefully bolster Egypt’s  extraterrestrial intel by facilitating transmission of high-definition images of cosmic  bodies to command centers, thereby substantially advancing Egypt’s position in global  space contention and contributing to its technological developmen
